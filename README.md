# ARM-UAV_KXH-OS
KXH-OS LFS port for ARM-family processors<br><br>


In general, the system is based on the assumption that the ARM devices exist as the executive computer in the drone itself.<br>
It is possible to use the system as such on a device like Raspberry Pi or Banana Pi, but at your own risk<br>




## System specifications<br><br><br>

The system was based on modular operation and the lightest possible file structure to perform operations in a shorter time.<br>

By default, the uploaded system has a KXH-SYSTEM sub-shell from which all system commands are executed

### Requirements:<br>
      Some acknowlage in Bash
      ARM based device
